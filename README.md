# FPGA-Wav-Player
FPGA Wav Player by Christopher Spadavecchia &amp; Eli Shtindler

This is our final project for CPE 487 taught by Professor Bernard Yett. 

The goal of our project is to be able to play a .wav file on the Nexys A7 FPGA.

To be able to achieve this goal, we had to download the .wav file to a Micro SD, read the file from the Micro SD, and play back the data from the file.
